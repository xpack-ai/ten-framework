## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

Before getting started with TEN + XPack, ensure you have the following:

| Category | Requirements |
| --- | --- |
| **Keys** | ‚Ä¢ Agora [App ID](https://docs.agora.io/en/video-calling/get-started/manage-agora-account?platform=web#create-an-agora-project) and [App Certificate](https://docs.agora.io/en/video-calling/get-started/manage-agora-account?platform=web#create-an-agora-project) (free minutes every month) <br>‚Ä¢ [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-api/) API key (any LLM that is compatible with OpenAI)<br>‚Ä¢ [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/) ASR (free credits available with signup)<br>‚Ä¢ [Elevenlabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) TTS (free credits available with signup) |
| **Installation** | ‚Ä¢ [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) / [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)<br>‚Ä¢ [Node.js(LTS) v18](https://nodejs.org/en) |
| **Minimum System Requirements** | ‚Ä¢ CPU >= 2 Core<br>‚Ä¢ RAM >= 4 GB |

<br>

> \[!NOTE]
>
> **macOS: Docker setting on Apple Silicon**
>
> Uncheck "Use Rosetta for x86/amd64 emulation" in Docker settings, it may result in slower build times on ARM, but performance will be normal when deployed to x64 servers.
